Create Instance of MongoDB as Container
Now you will create a MongoDB container with the image that is available on your local machine. You can create / update databases using this container.

The following command creates a container with the name geeksarray-mongo. Execute this command using GitBash or any other terminal.

docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name geeksarray-mongo mongo
docker run: creates a container(instance) of the image and starts it.
-d: run container in detached mode. This Means the docker container runs in the background of the terminal. It does not accept input or show output.
-p 27017:27107: maps port 27017 of the container to port 27017 of the host. The syntax of the mapping port is -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT.

db.createCollection('CalendarMongo')
